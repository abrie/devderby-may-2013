#Mozilla Dev Derby May 2013
###An AR Game

There are two rules: capture the pieces before they fall on the ground; and capture them in the specified order. If you succeed you'll move onto the next level. If you fail... well, then try again.

This game uses AR markers to control wormholes; which are portals between a 2D and 3D world. In order to play you'll need to print the AR marker page. A link is provided in-game. Fasten the page to a piece of cardboard for ease of manipulation. Show the page to your webcam, and align the reticule with a marker to open a wormhole. A gameplay video link is provided should you need an example or are unwilling to waste ink/paper.

Please note that a well-lit play area is required. Increasing your display's brightness is a good way to provide illumination; since it casts light onto the markers.
